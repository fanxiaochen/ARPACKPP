Arpack++ known bugs as of 5/20/1998.

1. The CC compiler has only a double precision complex class, so
   the examples that use single precision complex data will not
   work properly when compiled with CC.

2. Because function templates that contain default parameters are
   not allowed by the CC compiler, the examples under the areig 
   directory will not compile with CC.

1. 01/27/97:

   [s,d]sapps.f: Loop 50 (line 375) has an incorrect upper bound:
                 replace
                    do 50 j = 1, min( j+jj, kplusp )
                                     ^^^ 
                 with
                    do 50 j = 1, min( i+jj, kplusp )
                                     ^^^


   [s,d]napps.f: Loop 70 (line 433) has an incorrect upper bound:
                 replace
                    do 70 j = 1, min( j+jj, kplusp )
                                     ^^^
                 with
                    do 70 j = 1, min( i+jj, kplusp )
                                     ^^^

   [c,z]napps.f: Loop 70 (line 365) has an incorrect upper bound:
                 replace
                    do 70 j = 1, min( j+jj, kplusp )
                                     ^^^
                 with
                    do 70 j = 1, min( i+jj, kplusp )
                                     ^^^

   Without the change the code will not compile on NEC.
   The parallel version of these routine needs to be modified 
   as well.

2. 03/28/97:

   In [s,d]ndrv4.f [s,d]ndrv5.f [s,d]ndrv6.f, the array SELECT
   is delecared as 

            select(maxnev)

   It should be changed to 

            select(maxncv)


3. 03/28/97:

   There are two empty files [s,d]naupe.f in the SRC directory.
   They are not part of the ARPACK.  The user should ignore
   them.


4. 03/28/97:

   In [s,d]seupd.f, select(ncv) is declared before ncv is declared.

   Should move the declaration of select(ncv) after

c     %-----------------%
c     | Array Arguments |
c     %-----------------%


5. 03/28/97:

   all banded drivers in EXAMPLES/BAND directory have not been
   checked in.  Although these are the current version, the SCCS 
   infomartion do not show the correct version number and dates.

6. 03/28/97:

   In [s,d]naupd.f the following check:

            else if (mode .lt. 1 .or. mode .gt. 5) then
                                                ^^
                                                ierr = -10

   should be changed to

            else if (mode .lt. 1 .or. mode .gt. 4) then
                                                ^^
                                                ierr = -10


   In [c,z]naupd.f the following check:

         else if (mode .lt. 1 .or. mode .gt. 5) then
                                            ^^
                                                ierr = -10
   
   should be changed to

         else if (mode .lt. 1 .or. mode .gt. 3) then
                                            ^^
                                                ierr = -10

7. 04/02/97:

   The mass matrix in the drivers 

                [s,d]ndrv4.f (NONSYM)
                [s,d]nbdr4.f (BAND)
                [c,z]ndrv4.f (COMPLEX)
                [c,z]nbdr4.f (BAND)

   needs to be scaled by 1/6 to match the piecewise 
   linear finite element discretization of the 1-d 
   convection-diffusion operator as explained in the
   documentation.

8. 04/03/97:
 
   The documentation for the SELECT array in [s,d]seupd.f should
   say:

c  SELECT  Logical array of dimension NCV.  (INPUT/WORKSPACE)
                                      ^^^^         ^^^^^^^^^^
